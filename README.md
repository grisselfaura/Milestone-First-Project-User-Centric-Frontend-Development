# Agronut Perú

Welcome to my Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute!

Agronut Perú is an e-commerce website which interacts with Farmers and influence Agriculture productivity in a suistanable and responsible way. 
It provides information and convinient solution about specific crops fertilizers which can be order online without going to a far away physical shop. 

This website is part of my portfolio to present to prospective employers and also a demo-version for Agronut Perú (as it's potential website).

## Demo

You can check out the website [here](https://grisselfaura.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/)!

## UX

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel. 

For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly design. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose. In the 'Work/Travail' section, I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to each GitHub Repository and live demo. A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access. 
 

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
4. 
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
