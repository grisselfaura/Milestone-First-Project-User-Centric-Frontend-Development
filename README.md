# Agronut Perú

Welcome to my Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute!

Agronut Perú is an website which interacts with Farmers and influence agriculture productivity in a susteinable and responsible way. 
It provides information and convinient solution about specific crops fertilizers which can be requested online without going to a far away physical shop. 

This website is part of my portfolio to present to prospective employers and also a demo-version for Agronut Perú (as it's potential website).

## Demo

## UX

- My goal on the website design was to make it as easy as possible for the potential customers to access the information on the site while striving for a simple layout approach. 

- The design color scheme was chosen by a local graphic designer with further insight to the peruvian marketing trends to create a colorful visual impact and straighforward easy-to-use feeling. 

- For the buyers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of the company, the product's categories and a contact form to request such product via a user friendly design.
  This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of Agronut Perú, the products catalog and an easy-reliable option to contact Agronut Perú if they choose to obtain such product. 
  In the 'Contact us' section, I wanted them to be able to quickly reach Agronut Perú customer service and sales using a safely approach to avoid potential local internet scams. 
  A google map link showing the company address was also provided for their information. 

- For potential partnerships, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of the company oppportunities in the 'Join us' section and corresponding subsections. 
  [Subsections with corresponding information will be further developed upon company request}.

## Features

- ### Existing Features
- This site uses the Scrolling Nav feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. 
- The navbar is fixed to the top that collapses on scroll. The Navbar also uses the scrollSpy feature that highlights active page sections.
- Each section contains an arrow icon at the end of each section to inform the user that there is further reading below. The last arrow will bring the user back to the landing page.
- Buttons are named after corresponding section to promote user friendly approach. In addition hover feature has been added all buttons to highlight user interaction with potential action.

- ### Features Left to Implement
* In the future i would like to add a quality section (depending on client desire to add certifications for its products and service) to be link to the Quality item in the NavBar.
* In addition the readmore button from each product category needs to be link to each individual product caracteristics and its product code.
* Furthermore the links to the subsections buttons in the join us sections (depending on client's layout desire) needs to be added.
* Lastly, I would like to add a blog section with videos and tips regarding susteinable farming. 

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
3.1. Scrolling Nav
3.2. Bootstrap Footers with map
4. Font-awesome (4.7.0)<!--********would u call this a technology********-->
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
